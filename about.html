                    A good teacher is one who is able to explain and demonstrate concepts in a variety of ways for a
                    variety of different learners and learning styles. A good teacher is a good learner—they learn how
                    their student(s) learn—and modify their teaching accordingly.

                    A great nation is build though a teacher in the four walls of a class room. A teacher’s profession
                    is a noble one, it is said Yes, it is a noble one. I feel it is the basis of all other professions.
                    It is the teacher who creates doctors, scientists, engineers, artist, dramatist, singer, builder and
                    all other professionals.
